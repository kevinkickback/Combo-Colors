## How to Use

   - `asw` - Arc System Works style (Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, etc.)
   - `alt` - Modern Alternative style (DNF Duel, Granblue, etc.)
   - `trd` - Traditional style (Street Fighter, Marvel vs Capcom Infinite, etc.)
   - **EXAMPLE:** `cc_profile: asw`<br><br>

**2.** Select the desired notation profile<br>
**3.** Customize using the color picker

## NOTE:
This plugin was originally developed for personal use. Features such as adding or modifying profiles were not implemented, as I never needed them. Given my current schedule, it's unlikely I will work on these features in the future. However, if anyone is interested in building them, please feel free to do so—I’d be happy to commit the changes. Also, if you're looking for a much more comprehensive notation icon plugin please check out <a href="https://github.com/Loac/obsidian-fight-note">Obsidian Fight Note</a>.
